# Rollercoaster Ride Simulator ðŸŽ¢

Welcome to the **Rollercoaster Ride Simulator**! ðŸš€

Get ready for an exciting ride, where you'll experience the thrills of a rollercoaster right from your screen! This project simulates the process of buying a ticket for a rollercoaster based on your height and age, and even allows you to add a fun photo souvenir to your experience!

## How It Works

The program will ask you for your height and age to determine if you're tall enough to ride. If you're tall enough, it will then calculate the cost of your ticket based on your age. Here's how it works:

1. **Height Check**: Are you tall enough to ride? If you're 120 cm or taller, you're ready to go!
2. **Age Check**: 
   - **Child (under 12)**: Pay only $5! ðŸ§’
   - **Youth (12-18)**: Get a discounted ticket for just $7! ðŸ‘¦ðŸ‘§
   - **Adult (over 18)**: Full price is $12. ðŸ‘©ðŸ‘¨
3. **Photo Option**: Want a memory of your thrilling ride? Add a photo for just $3. ðŸ“¸
   
If you're not tall enough yet, don't worryâ€”keep growing, and try again soon! ðŸŒ±

## Example:

Here's an example of how the program will interact with you:

```
Welcome to the rollercoaster!
What is your height in cm? 130
You can ride the rollercoaster!
What is your age? 16
Youth tickets are $7.
Do you want a photo taken? Y or N. Y
Your final bill is $10
```

If you're under 120 cm:

```
Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.
```
